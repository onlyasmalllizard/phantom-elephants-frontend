# Brief

- Create an application which the coaches can use to monitor and track student progress over the course of the 12 weeks of teaching. As the School of Code is taking on 192 bootcampers for their next cohort they have challenged us to create an application which makes it easier for them to see all the work which is submitted by the students in one place.

# DEMETER

Demeter is a platform which was created to as part of our final project at School of Code. The aim of this application was to create a dashboard which displays data regarding each student such as their:

- Bootcamp
- Region
- Workshop scores
- Feedback
- Daily quizzes
- Attendance
- Reflections
- Mood based on their reflections

We decided to use a dashboard from creative tim which used tailwind css. On this dashboard we decided to have 4 pages:
_*Main dashboard*_

- On this page we have colour coordinated alerts which are placed on the main dashboard to make it more convenient for the coaches to identify students that are struggling as well as students tha are excelling.
  We also have a :
- Student watch list
- overall view of experience and quiz scores
- Overall view of Attendance

_*Cohort View*_
