## SOC Brief

- Create an application which the coaches can use to monitor and track student progress over the course of the 12 weeks of teaching. As the School of Code is going national and taking on 192 bootcampers for their next cohort, they have challenged us to create an application which makes it easier for them to spot trends and also identify students who may need support all in one place.

# DEMETER DASHBOARD API

- Bootcamp
- Region
- Workshop scores
- Feedback
- Daily quizzes
- Attendance
- Reflections
- Mood based on their reflections

We decided to use a dashboard from creative tim which used tailwind css. On this dashboard we decided to have 4 pages:
_*Main dashboard*_

- On this page we have colour coordinated alerts which are placed on the main dashboard to make it more convenient for the coaches to identify students that are struggling as well as students tha are excelling.
  We also have a :
